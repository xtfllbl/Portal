# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here, including anything an
agent or user must do when upgrading. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) and match `version` in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

Read this before upgrading. General upgrade rules:

- **OpenClaw hook changes only take effect after re-copying and restarting.**
  The hook runs from a copy: re-run
  `cp -r ~/.openclaw/skills/self-improving-agent/hooks/openclaw ~/.openclaw/hooks/self-improvement`
  and restart the gateway after upgrading.
- `.learnings/` files are user data and are never migrated or overwritten by
  upgrades; first-use initialisation is idempotent and only creates missing
  files.

## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.2] - 2026-08-06

> 4.0.1 is skipped: that version number was already used by a build
> published to ClawHub, so it is not reusable here.

### Fixed

- **Install commands and clone URL in the docs were wrong** (#24). The
  advertised `clawdhub install` command does not exist. The documented
  commands are now `openclaw skills install @pskoett/self-improving-agent`
  (built-in, installs into the active workspace) and
  `clawhub install @pskoett/self-improving-agent` (ClawHub CLI,
  `npm i -g clawhub`, installs into `./skills` under the current working
  directory). Both take the `@owner/slug` form — a bare slug is only
  accepted for already-installed or unambiguous skills. Fixed in
  `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `references/openclaw-integration.md`.
- The manual `git clone` URL used the wrong owner handle
  (`peterskoett` → `pskoett`). The old handle only resolved via a web
  redirect, which `git clone` does not follow, so manual installs failed on
  a fresh machine.

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` at the repo root): runs the
  hook test suite, type-checks `handler.ts` (strict mode, against a CI-only
  type stub), and syntax-checks `extract-skill.sh` on every push to master
  and every PR.

### Changed

- **Repo restructured for ClawHub publishing**: the skill package now lives
  in the repo's `self-improving-agent/` subfolder (SKILL.md, assets, hooks,
  references, scripts, this changelog), keeping repo-level files (README,
  `.github/`) out of the published skill. Install by copying the subfolder,
  not the repo root — install/upgrade commands in the docs are updated.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` corrected from `self-improvement` to
  `self-improving-agent` to match the skill folder name, as the Agent Skills
  spec requires. The OpenClaw *hook* keeps its `self-improvement` name, so
  existing hook installs and `openclaw hooks enable self-improvement` are
  unaffected.

### Upgrade notes (4.0.x → 4.0.2)

Documentation only — no skill behavior, hook, or `.learnings/` changes. No
action needed beyond reinstalling if you want the corrected install docs.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-04

### Removed

- **This distribution is now OpenClaw-only.** Removed the Claude Code /
  Codex / Copilot integrations: `scripts/activator.sh`,
  `scripts/error-detector.sh`, `references/hooks-setup.md`, and the
  multi-agent setup/support sections in `SKILL.md` and
  `references/uninstall.md`. For other agents, use the original multi-agent
  version: https://github.com/pskoett/pskoett-ai-skills.

### Changed

- Promotion targets are now the OpenClaw workspace files (`SOUL.md`,
  `TOOLS.md`, `AGENTS.md`), with the project's own agent file as the target
  for project-specific patterns.
- Hook docs and code comments describe the session-end sweep on its own
  terms (OpenClaw has no per-tool-call event) instead of contrasting with
  other platforms.

### Upgrade notes (0.3.0 → 4.0.0)

1. If you configured the Claude Code/Codex hooks from earlier versions,
   remove the stale `.claude/settings.json` / `.codex/settings.json` entries
   pointing at `activator.sh` / `error-detector.sh`, and switch to the
   original multi-agent skill for those platforms.
2. Nothing changes for OpenClaw installs beyond the usual re-copy of the
   hook directory; `.learnings/` data and entry formats are unaffected.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Pattern-Key generalized to all three log files**: the `ERRORS.md` and
  `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` entry formats now carry a `Pattern-Key` field
  (recommended for errors, optional for features), joining `LEARNINGS.md`
  where it was previously limited to the simplify-and-harden feed.
- **Pattern-Key Taxonomy** section in `SKILL.md`: controlled `area.symptom`
  namespaces (`api`, `auth`, `build`, `config`, `deps`, `fs`, `net`,
  `runtime`, `shell`, `vcs`, plus `simplify`/`harden`), with reuse-before-mint
  and one-key-per-entry rules.
- The OpenClaw session-end error sweep stamps deterministic `Pattern-Key`
  values on auto-detected entries (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError` →
  `deps.module-not-found`), making them recurrence-countable with no agent
  discipline required.

### Changed

- Grep-by-`Pattern-Key` is now the documented **default dedup step** when
  logging; keyword grep is the fallback. Recurrences are folded into the
  existing entry (`Recurrence-Count`, `Last-Seen`, `See Also`) instead of
  duplicated.
- Tightened `SKILL.md` (hook sections, taxonomy, duplicated setup blocks) to
  keep the always-loaded skill prompt compact.

### Fixed

- `scripts/extract-skill.sh` is now committed with the executable bit set —
  previously every install needed a manual `chmod +x`.

### Upgrade notes (0.2.0 → 0.3.0)

1. Re-copy the OpenClaw hook and restart the gateway (see general rules
   above) to get Pattern-Key stamping on swept entries.
2. Existing `.learnings/` entries without `Pattern-Key` remain valid — the
   field is additive. Add keys opportunistically when touching old entries.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **OpenClaw session-end error sweep** (`hooks/openclaw/`): the hook now also
  fires on `command:new` / `command:reset`, scans the ended session's
  transcript for the same error patterns as `scripts/error-detector.sh`, and
  appends pending entries (`Source: openclaw-error-sweep`) to
  `<workspace>/.learnings/ERRORS.md`. Opt-in: runs only when
  `<workspace>/.learnings/` exists. Excerpts are capped, truncated, redacted,
  and deduplicated.
- Pending-triage note in the bootstrap reminder when auto-detected error
  entries await review.
- Test suite: `node --test hooks/openclaw/handler.test.js` (no dependencies).
- Docs: "Error Detection on OpenClaw" section and platform support matrix in
  `references/openclaw-integration.md`; uninstall guide in
  `references/uninstall.md`; this changelog.

### Changed

- `hooks/openclaw/HOOK.md` events metadata is now
  `["agent:bootstrap", "command:new", "command:reset"]`.
- Docs now state explicitly that `scripts/error-detector.sh` is Claude Code
  only (OpenClaw has no `PostToolUse` equivalent).

### Upgrade notes (0.1.x → 0.2.0)

1. Re-copy the hook and restart the gateway (see general rules above).
2. To enable the new error sweep: `mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/.learnings`.
   Without that directory, behavior is identical to 0.1.0.
3. No breaking changes; no `.learnings/` migration needed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Initial release: `SKILL.md` with logging formats (`LEARNINGS.md`,
  `ERRORS.md`, `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md`), promotion workflow, and skill
  extraction.
- OpenClaw bootstrap-reminder hook (`agent:bootstrap`).
- Claude Code hook scripts: `activator.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) and
  `error-detector.sh` (PostToolUse).
- Reference guides for hooks setup and OpenClaw integration.
